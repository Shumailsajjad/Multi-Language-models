### Multi-Language-models
Machine Learning Project

##### We may deal with research problems that apply qualitative and quantitative skills in real life. To prepare for such situations, this project has helped me develop skills that may eventually be useful in my higher studies. The classification project was a mixed-method approach to create a multi-language recognition model using three famous supervised machine learning techniques. For this purpose, I completed a survey on the SurveyCTO application containing 100 daily life questions in Urdu, English, and mixed Urdu-English. I used Praat software to record my answers and represented the recorded (wave) files by 13-dimensional Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). MFCCs are a widely used representation of human speech for classification problems. The collected data was split into 80:20 train-test sets. KNN, Support vector machines, and Neural networks algorithms were trained on these MFC coefficients to classify my audio recordings into three classes: “English (en),” “Urdu (ur),” and “Mixed (ue).”  I did 5-fold cross-validation for each of these supervised techniques and reported the validation and training loss using graphs in Python software. The models’ robustness was evaluated based on their accuracy, macro-average (precision, recall, F1), and confusion matrix on the test set.
